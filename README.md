# Music-Muse mp3 Player.


## 🛠️  Introduction 
MusicMuse is more than just a Python music player; it's a labor of love inspired by a deep-seated passion for music and a quest to deliver a pure and distraction-free listening experience. This project is the brainchild of Jeremiah Martey (myself), who serves as the sole developer, project manager, UI/UX designer, and more. I undertook this project as part of Holberton School's portfolio project, with a mission to create a lightweight, user-friendly music player for all music enthusiasts.

## Functionalities of MusicMuse
This mp3 player comes with the play, next, back, pause, buttons to help navigate the music player.

                <h2>About MusicMuse</h2>
                <p>MusicMuse is a project inspired by a deep love for music and the journey of self-discovery through code.
                    As a solo project, It was conceived during my time at Holberton School. as an avid 
                    music lover, I found that streaming music was getting a lot more distracting, especially
                    during studies. Hence i decided to make a user-friendly music player that allows one to load music they love
                    and listen without any interferance.</p> 
                    <p>MusicMuse is not just a project; it's a testament to personal growth, creativity, and the desire
                    to share the joy of music with the world. The project embodies the essence of simplicity and
                    user-friendliness, offering an intuitive music listening experience.</p>
